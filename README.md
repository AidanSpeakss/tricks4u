# Tricks4u: Portfolio Project

# **Project Details**
**Purpose:**<br/>
Tricks4U is a place to learn new skating tricks, it has a catalog of informational tutorial-like videos that make it easy to find new tricks and to learn them.

**Audience:**<br/>
The target audience for Tricks4U is teenage skateboarders from ages 13 to 18.

**Content:**<br/>
Video tutorials about how to perform specific skateboarding tricks.

**Competition:**<br/>
https://youtube.com already has thousands of skateboarding tutorial videos, but this site aims to make it easier to find skateboarding related videos, which should appeal to the audience.

https://www.skateboardhere.com/ also already does this, but its content is text and picture-based, videos would serve this audience better.

**Site Map:**<br/>
This website will use a simple hierarchy. The most important part of this hierarchy is the video catalog. I’ve decided to organize by category, where different types of tricks have separate pages. This will make it easier for users to find specific content, and it will prevent them from being overwhelmed by seeing all of these videos on one page.

I chose this color scheme because the grey’s give a concrete feal, something that will be appealing to the urban environment skaters are often in. And I chose the light yellow as my accent color because it is a bright color that will make things contrast and pop better, but also because it reminds me of the yellow stripes in roads, which would be appealing to my audience, because of the environment they’re often in.

**Font Family:**<br/>
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat
This font-family was not on the site you listed but is a font-family I have worked with before and is a favorite of mine. I think it is a clean simple font that is easy to read and modern. I think this simple aesthetic matches the skating scene and aesthetics, whereas a cursive font would be too exotic, and a basic font like Ariel would be too plain.
Font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;


**Accessibility:**<br/>
I plan to use media-queries and dynamic sizing to ensure that the site is responsive and displayed properly on different devices. I will also ensure that the videos include subtitles and that elements have good aria-labels and make good use of other accessibility features in HTML5 and CSS. The elements will also have good contrast to make it easy to read, and text-sizing will be as large as it can be without disrupting the design, look, or feel of the site. I will also use proper video and image compression technology to ensure the content on the site is accessible to people with slower internet connections. I will also use as little Javascript to ensure good performance on older devices, and ensure to optimize my code for performance by loosely following standards that Google sets for AMP websites.
